# i3-gapps dotfiles

This is my dotfile repo containing my config files for i3-gapps along with compton and polybar. It also contains my bashrc and vimrc in case you wanted to look at them. Most of my setup was inspired by r/unixporn.

#Installation
Clone this repo to your home directory using
```shell
git clone github.com/rutujsg/dotfiles.git
```
And then move/copy all the contents in the `~/dotfiles` to `~` by
```shell
cd dotfiles
cp -r * ~/
```
I plan to use GNU Stow soon to make this easier in the future.
